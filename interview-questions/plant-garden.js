 * Given an array of 0s and 1s that represent a garden, where 0 is a plot that hasnâ€™t been
 * planted on, and 1 is a plot that has been planted on, return true if n plants can be
 * planted without touching another plant.
 *
 * Example:
 *   $ garden = [1,0,0,0,1]
 *   $ canPlant(garden, 1)
 *   $ true // plant at position 2
 *   $ canPlant(garden, 4)
 *   $ false // there are only 3 plots, and two of them can't be planted on
 */

// If we use a simple for-loop, all we're asking for is every slot in the garden where
// there's no planting in slots [-1, 0, 1] relative to us. We can craft the comparison
// so we get edges "for free" (going over the left or right bound of the garden counts
// as not being planted). Last, we need to make sure we don't accidentally count any
// slots twice -- in a for-loop we can just increment the index once more. (Otherwise,
// for a garden like [1,0,0,0,0,1], we might count [1,0,x,x,0,1] as plantable slots.)
